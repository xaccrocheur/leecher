* leecher.pl

** USAGE

leecher.pl [URI] [PATH] [FILE_EXT]

Where URI is the address of a web page, PATH a directory where you
want to save the files, and FILE_EXT the extension of the files you
want to leech. You will then get a visual output of the file download
progress. Sit back, relax, and watch the pixels move.

Leecher lets you download all the files linked from a particular web
page, allowing filtering on said file extension.

** FEATURES
- So yes, the URI can contain a lot of nasty stuff (the things ppl put
  in filenames... Sheesh) the script will try to take care of this.
- If the directory does not exist, you will be asked to create it.
- All non-existing dirs leading to the directory will be created.
- For obvious reasons, if your directory (PATH) name contains spaces
  (Sheesh) you'll have to enclose the it in quotes of sorts.
- If for some reason you interrupt the script and re-launch it with
  the same PATH (or if URI contains several links to the same file)
  the script will take care of not downloading the same file
  twice. All hail CURL !
